# REPORT PARITY LOOP — shared state

**Goal:** get Peer's live job and event reports to within **5%** of the design
spec plates. **Manager:** the main Claude session. **Loop:** A → B → C → A …

**Template (the contract):**
`template for web design/Peer-design-spec-original.pdf` — 21 pages.
**Plate 02 is the job report. Plate 03 is the event report.** Nothing else in the
PDF is in scope for this loop.

## §0. HOW TO RESUME — READ THIS FIRST, EVERY TIME

This file is the **only** durable state. A session can end at any moment; the
next agent must be able to pick up from this file alone.

1. Read **§1 CURRENT STATE**. It names whose turn it is and which round.
2. Read the latest round's section in §4.
3. Do only your own role's job (§2). Do not do another role's job.
4. **Append your output to §4 under the current round, then update §1**, in the
   same commit as any code you changed.
5. If you run out of budget mid-task, write what you have into §4 with the
   status `PARTIAL` and say exactly what remains. Never leave §1 pointing at a
   turn you silently abandoned.

**The one rule that makes this restartable:** §1 must always be true. Update it
before you stop, not after you finish.

## §1. CURRENT STATE — THE SOURCE OF TRUTH

```
ROUND:            1
WHOSE TURN:       A
STATUS:           NOT STARTED
LAST DIFFERENCE:  (not measured yet)
GATE (<5%):       NOT MET
```

**History of measured difference, newest last:** _(A appends one line per round)_

| Round | A's measured difference | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| — | — | — |

## §2. ROLES — DO ONLY YOUR OWN JOB

### Agent A — Reviewer

Compare the **live** job report and event report against plates 02 and 03.

- Read the plates from the PDF (`pages: "3-6"` covers plate 02 and the start of
  plate 03; read further as needed — find them, do not guess).
- Get the live reports. Either render the components to static markup the way
  `web/src/app/jobs/[id]/page.test.ts` does, or drive the dev server. Say which
  you used.
- Produce a **numbered difference list**. For each: what the plate has, what the
  build has, and which one is missing or wrong. Be specific enough that B can
  find it without re-deriving your work.
- Give a **single percentage**: how far the build is from the plate, and say in
  one sentence how you arrived at it (e.g. sections present/absent, ordering,
  content shape). A rough but honest method beats a precise-sounding invented one.
- **Rank the list**: what a reader would notice first goes first.

A does **not** change code. A does **not** investigate causes.

**A's exit condition:** when the measured difference is **below 5%**, set
`GATE (<5%): MET` in §1 and stop. The manager takes over.

### Agent B — Investigator

Take A's latest numbered list. For each item, find **why** the build differs.

- Name the file and the specific code that produces the current behaviour.
- Say whether it is missing, wrong, or deliberately different.
- **If something looks deliberate — a decision recorded in a HANDOFF file or a
  code comment — say so and do not recommend reversing it.** Flag it for the
  manager instead. Several plate deviations are decided policy, not defects.
- Output a **fix guide**: one entry per difference, in the order C should work.

B does **not** change code.

### Agent C — Implementer

Work through B's fix guide in order.

- After each item, run the gate:
  `cd web && npx vitest run && npx tsc --noEmit && npx eslint`
- **Baseline: 81 files / 798 tests passing, typecheck clean, lint exactly 1
  pre-existing error (`src/components/persona/quiz.tsx:46`).** Do not regress it.
- Never delete a test to make a change pass. Rewrite the assertion to state the
  new contract and say in a comment which item changed it.
- Do not skip the live benchmark via `PEER_PROFILE_SNAPSHOT_PATH`.
- Commit per item. Then hand back to A.

---

## §3. GROUND RULES FOR EVERY AGENT

- Working directory: `C:\I\Personal\Github - start up project\Peer`
- Branch: `feature/summary-report-revamp`. **Do not create a branch or worktree.**
- `web/AGENTS.md`: this is **not** the Next.js you know (16.2.3, React 19.2.4).
  Read `web/node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before touching routing.
- No API key is needed. Never log, commit, or write a key to a file.
- If you start the dev server, `npm run kill-orphans` from `web/` afterwards and
  confirm no node process is left listening.
- **Do not open a PR.**
- Prior phase decisions live in `HANDOFF-phase7..10*.md`. Read before assuming
  something is a bug.
